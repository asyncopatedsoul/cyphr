http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system


Performance Rating is a hypothetical rating that would result from the games of a single event only. Some chess organizations use the "algorithm of 400" to calculate performance rating. According to this algorithm, performance rating for an event is calculated by taking (1) the rating of each player beaten and adding 400, (2) the rating of each player lost to and subtracting 400, (3) the rating of each player drawn, and (4) summing these figures and dividing by the number of games played.
Example: 2 Wins, 2 Losses
(w+400 + x+400 + y-400 + z-400)/4
[w+x+y+z+400(2)-400(2)]/4
This can be expressed by the following formula: Performance rating = [((Total of opponents' ratings) + 400 * (Wins - Losses)) / Games].
Example: If you beat a player with an elo rating of 1000,
Performance rating = (1000 + 400*1)/1 = 1400
If you beat two players with elo ratings of 1000,
Performance rating = (2000 + 400*2)/2 = 1400
If you draw,
Performance rating = (1000 + 400*0)/1 = 1000
This is a simplification, because it doesn't take account of K-factors (this factor is explained further below), but it offers an easy way to get an estimate of PR (Performance Rating).


The K-factor used by the USCF[edit source | editbeta]
The K-factor, in the USCF rating system, can be estimated by dividing 800 by the effective number of games a player's rating is based on (Ne) plus the number of games the player completed in a tournament (m).[11]
K = 800 / (N_e + m)\,
